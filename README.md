Inside this repo there are (from now) two projects.
### Escape PokemÃ³n (Pokemon Scape)
An small project that wanted to reinforce memory managment and file parsing concepts. it can be compiled using the following command: `gcc escape_pokemon.c  src/*.c -std=c99 -Wall -Wconversion -Wtype-limits -g -Werror -o  escape_pokemon` and runed using `./escape_pokemon ejemplo/objetos.txt ejemplo/interacciones.txt`. 
### TDA_1
A project whose objective was to help the student implement their firsts ADTs (abstract data types): list, queues and stacks. Furthermore, it had a testing framework that the student had to use, making tests and using them to, well, *test* their own code.
The ADTs can be runed using the command `gcc -g -std=c99 -Wall -Wconversion -Wtype-limits -pedantic -Werror -O2 src/*.c pruebas.c -o pruebas 2>&1` followed by `./pruebas 2>&1`.
